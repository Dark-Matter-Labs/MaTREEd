## Policy context <a name="policy"></a>

Since the beginning of her mandate, European Commission President von der Leyen stressed the need for Europe to lead the transition to a green and digital planet. The [6 political priorities of the European Commission 2019-2024](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en_0.pdf) include _A European Green Deal_ and _A Europe fit for the digital age_, which highlight the twin challenge of a green and digital transformation to push Europe towards more sustainable, resource-efficient, circular and climate-neutral solutions. Data is at the centre of this transformation and data-driven innovation is crucial to implement the objectives of the [European Green Deal](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52019DC0640) ‚Äì among others, [the ambition to become climate-neutral by 2050](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en) in line with the European Union‚Äôs commitment to global climate action under the [Paris Agreement](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en). The recent [European strategy for data](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0066&from=EN) envisages the establishment of European data spaces in strategic societal sectors. Among those, the Green Deal data space will leverage the potential of data in support of the Green Deal priority actions on climate change, circular economy, zero pollution, biodiversity, deforestation and compliance assurance.

In this broad context, the work presented here contributes to the activities of [Climate-KIC](https://www.climate-kic.org/), the European knowledge and innovation community committed to accelerate the European Union transition to a zero-carbon economy, and in particular to the [Cross KIC Sustainable Cities programme](https://eit.europa.eu/our-activities/opportunities/eit-innovation-communities-launch-cross-kic-sustainable-cities-calls) and its [initiative](https://www.climate-kic.org/news/collective-efforts-madrids-transition-carbon-neutrality/) to boost Madrid‚Äôs decarbonisation activities through the use of data. The focus of the initiative is to build a green city data space for Madrid, where different actors (including the public sector, businesses and citizens) can both contribute and make use of data for the collective social benefit towards the city‚Äôs carbon neutrality. The GREEMTA project, which contributes to the Madrid city data space, focusses its efforts on sustainable solutions for Madrid leveraging the potential of public sector data about trees and green areas. 


## Introduction to MaTREEd <a name="introduction"></a>

To answer the objectives of the [GREEMTA challenge](https://challenge.greemta.eu/), MaTREEd offers a prototype of a Tree Information System for Madrid neighborhoods which helps city administrators take informed decisions on urban tree management to mitigate the impact of climate change and facilitate transition towards a greener and more sustainable urban environment. MaTREEd, whose pronunciation recalls ‚ÄòMadrid‚Äô, makes use of the datasets of Madrid trees and neighborhoods to assess the current tree carbon stock and annual sequestration rate, i.e. the Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) stocked in and sequestered by trees every year, for each neighborhood. In addition, MaTREEd offers a simulator to evaluate the impact of user-defined tree-planting scenarios. MaTREEd provides a set of data processing algorithms and an interactive web application to visualize the results and run simulations. The code is available at the [project repository](https://github.com/GISdevio/MaTREEd) under the open source [European Union Public License (EUPL) v1.2](https://github.com/GISdevio/MaTREEd/blob/main/LICENSE).

The reminder of this document is organized as follows. The next section [Datasets](#datasets) lists the datasets used to develop MaTREEd. The [Methodology](#methodology) section describes the analytical steps performed to process the datasets and extract the results. This is followed by the [Webapp](#webapp) section, which introduces the MaTREEd web application and its functionality. Section [Conclusions](#conclusions) closes the document by outlining limitations and possible improvements.


## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>

MaTREEd is developed using the following datasets:

* **[trees in Madrid](https://challenge.greemta.eu/data/green/trees_madrid.zip)**, downloaded from the [challenge webpage on trees](https://challenge.greemta.eu/dataset/trees/) and including all the trees managed by the Municipality of Madrid, excluding trees in parks and gardens, areas of property or areas of recent construction not yet received by the Municipality. The dataset, which overall consists of 655‚Äô650 trees (point features), is provided by Madrid City Council under [this license](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default), which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/). The dataset is used as input to calculate and simulate the tree carbon stock for each neighborhood (see the [Methodology](#methodology) section);

* **[neighborhoods in Madrid](https://challenge.greemta.eu/data/administrative_units/neighborhoods_madrid.geojson)**, downloaded from the [challenge webpage on administrative units](https://challenge.greemta.eu/dataset/administrativeunits/) and including the 131 neighborhoods (polygon features) in which Madrid is divided. The dataset is provided by Madrid City Council under [this license](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default), which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=46b55cde99be2410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default). The dataset is used as the areal unit for the calculation and simulation of the tree carbon stock for each neighborhood (see the [Methodology](#methodology) section);

* **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)**, the geospatial database of the whole world created and managed by volunteers and [available under the ODbL license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). The OpenStreetMap database is not used directly (i.e. as single geospatial features), but through [map tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles) (in particular the [standard tile layer](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Standard_tile_layer)) used as the basemap in the MaTREEd web application. 


## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

To be used in MaTREEd web application, the datasets of trees and neighborhoods in Madrid are processed to achieve the following: 1) cleaning; 2) intersection with the dataset of neighborhoods in Madrid and calculation of tree summary statistics for each neighborhood; and 3) calculation of the tree carbon stock and sequestration rate for each neighborhood. Each of these three steps is described in the following. The code used to perform such processing steps is written in Python and makes use of some standard libraries ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/)). The whole processing script is available as an interactive [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and can be launched from [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GISdevio/MaTREEd/main) (NOTE: loading the environment may take a while).

1. Through a sequence of pre-processing steps, the dataset of trees in Madrid is cleaned by:

  * removing all the features (trees) having NaN values for the attributes `senescence`, `crown_diameter`, `height` and `trunk_girth`, which are the attributes used for computing the neighborhood statistics and the tree carbon indicators (see below); 
  * removing coarse outliers by filtering out extreme values for the attributes `crown_diameter`, `height` and `trunk_girth` using percentiles;

2. The datasets of trees and neighborhoods in Madrid are spatially joined in order to add the neighborhood information to each tree. This allows to compute the following tree summary statistics ‚Äì corresponding to the maps shown in the web application (see the [Webapp](#webapp) section) ‚Äì for each neighborhood, as follows:

  * **Tree density** [trees/km<sup>2</sup>] (`tree_density`): number of trees per km<sup>2</sup>
  * **Mean tree trunk girth** [m] (`mean_trunk_girth`): mean value of the `trunk girth` of the available trees
  * **Mean tree height** [m] (`mean_height`): mean value of the `height` of the available trees
  * **Mean tree canopy diameter** [m] (`mean_crown_diameter`): mean value of the `crown_diameter` of the available trees
  * **Tree canopy coverage** [%] (`tree_coverage`): percentage of the neighborhood area covered by trees, computed as `mean_crown_diameter*ùúã/neighborhood_area`, where `neighborhood area` is the area of the neighborhood
  * **Fractions of deciduous and evergreen trees** [%] (`fraction_deciduous`) and (`fraction_evergreen`): percentage of deciduous and evergreen trees of the total number of available trees (`trees_count`).
  * **Tree species** (`tree_species`): the percentages of occurrence of the three most popular tree species, and the percentage of occurrence of all the other tree species (considered together)

3. The tree carbon stock and annual sequestration rate for each neighborhood are computed as the sum of the CO<sub>2</sub> stocked and the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration rate contributed by each single tree available in the neighborhood. In turn, these are computed using simplified [allometric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_allometry) based on the `trunk_girth`, the tree diameter (`diameter`, computed as `trunk_girth/ùúã`) and the value of the `senescence` attribute - distinguishing between deciduous trees (value `CADUCIFOLIO`) and evergreen trees (value `PERENNIFOLIO`) - as follows:

* **CO<sub>2</sub> stock** [Kg] (`stock`):

```
if senescence == PERENNIFOLIO
    stock = (0.16155*((trunk_girth/ùúã)*100)^2.310647)*0.5*3.67
if senescence == CADUCIFOLIO
    stock = (0.035702*((trunk_girth/ùúã)*100)^2.580671)*0.5*3.67
```

where `0.5` is the fraction of the average carbon content on the tree‚Äôs dry weight total volume and `3.67` is the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> to C (`44/12 = 3.67`) (see [here](https://www.ecomatcher.com/how-to-calculate-co2-sequestration/)); the multiplier `100` is used because the calculation assumes that the value of `trunk_girth/ùúã`, i.e. `diameter`, is expressed in cm. These equations are presented and explained in [this scientific paper](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/mcpherson/psw_2011_mcpherson009.pdf). 

* **CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration** [Kg/y] (`sequestration`): 

```
diameter_t0 = (trunk_girth_t0/ùúã)*100
diameter_t1 = diameter_t0 + (-0.5425 + 0.3189*ln((trunk_girth_t0/ùúã)*100))
sequestration = stock(t1) - stock(t0)
```

where `diameter_t0` and `diameter_t1` are the initial diameter of the tree and the diameter of the tree after one year, respectively; `trunk_girth_t0` is the initial trunk girth of the tree; and `stock(t1)` and `stock(t0)` are the initial tree carbon stock and the tree carbon stock after one year, which are computed through the equation above using the initial value and the value after one year of `trunk_girth`. The equation models the annual growth of the diameter of a tree and is derived from [this scientific paper](https://iforest.sisef.org/contents/?id=ifor0635-005).

For each neighborhood, the values of `stock` and `sequestration` for all the available trees are summed to obtain the total values. These values are finally divided by the area of the neighborhood to obtain the **areal CO<sub>2</sub> stock** [Kg/km<sup>2</sup>] (`areal_stock`) and the **areal CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration** [Kg/y/km<sup>2</sup>] (`areal_sequestration`).


## Webapp <a name="webapp"></a>

As mentioned in the [Introduction] section, the MaTREEd web application (available [here](https://gisdevio.github.io/MaTREEd/#/)) acts as a Tree Information System for Madrid neighborhoods offering two main functions: i) visualization of the results achieved by applying the methodology described above, which depicts the current situation in Madrid in terms of carbon stock and sequestration rate; and ii) simulation of the increase in the carbon stock and sequestration rate, in any user-defined scenario where a certain number of trees with specific characteristics are added in a neighborhood.

The interface of the web application consists of a main map viewer and a layer menu on the right side. The map viewer displays the layer selected in the layer menu (only one layer at a time) on top of the OpenStreetMap basemap. When selected, the layers available in the layer menu show various thematic maps according to the values of the tree summary statistics computed in step 2 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section for each neighborhood, i.e. `tree_density`, `mean_trunk_girth`, `mean_height`, `mean_height`, `mean_crown_diameter` and `tree_coverage`. From the layer menu, the maps of areal carbon stock and areal sequestration rate for each neighborhood, i.e. `areal_stock` and `areal_sequestration`, respectively, are also available. Each of the seven thematic maps is accompanied by its own legend displaying the quantitative intervals of the classes depicted in the map. The selected layer is automatically moved at the top of the layer tree.

When a neighborhood is clicked on the map, a table appears on the left side of the interface showing additional information on that neighborhood. This includes the total number of available trees (`trees_count`), the number of valid tree records (i.e. the number of records remaining after cleaning, see step 1 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section), the fractions of deciduous and evergreen trees (`fraction_deciduous` and `fraction_evergreen`, respectively), the percentages of occurrence of the three most popular tree species and of the other species (`tree_species`), and the absolute values of carbon stock and sequestration rate (`stock` and `sequestration`, respectively). 

QUI METTERE SCREENSHOT DEL VIEWER

At the bottom of the table, a _Close_ button closes the table while a _Run simulation_ button opens a new dialogue allowing MaTREEd users to simulate how much the carbon stock and sequestration rate in the selected neighborhood increase when new trees are planted. In detail, users can arbitrarily define the number of conifer and/or broadleaf trees to plant and their `diameter`. Using the equations available in step 3 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section, the additional carbon stock (`delta_stock`) and sequestration rate (`delta_sequestration`) contributed by the new trees are computed, and the total (simulated) carbon stock (`final_stock`) and sequestration rate (`final_sequestration`) for the neighborhood are computed as the sum of the current ones (`current_stock` and `current_sequestration`) and additional ones:

```
final_stock = current_stock + delta_stock
final_sequestration = current_sequestration + delta_sequestration
```

Finally, the percentage of increase of carbon stock (`increase_stock`) and sequestration rate (`increase_sequestration`) are computed as:

```
increase_stock = delta_stock/current_stock*100
increase_sequestration = delta_sequestration/current_sequestration*100
```

## Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>

The MaTREEd web application is a prototype of a Tree Information System aimed to help Madrid administrators manage the green spaces across the city and their impact on the quality of the human environment. Directly addressing the need to fight climate change and meet the European objective to become climate-neutral by 2050, MaTREEd is a novel tool allowing Madrid administrators to simulate the impact ‚Äì in terms of annual CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration ‚Äì of planting new trees in any part of the city. With datasets provided by a public authority (in machine-readable formats and under an open access license) and processed using external algorithms, MaTREEd offers a valuable contribution to the city data space for Madrid as it extracts additional information for the primary benefit of the public body itself.

MaTREEd is currently a prototype, which was developed in a very short timeframe and might benefit from a number of potential improvements. First and foremost, it shall be noted that the results in terms of tree carbon stock and sequestration achieved with the equations in step 3 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section might not be fully reliable. Indeed, those equations are generic and the coefficients, which derive from the literature, should be first calibrated and adjusted on the Madrid area. In addition, the carbon stock and sequestration rate of each tree depend on its age, which was not available in the dataset of trees in Madrid. Finally, due again to the information available in the dataset of trees in Madrid, a simplification of the original equation (published in [this scientific paper](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/mcpherson/psw_2011_mcpherson009.pdf)) was adopted in the first equation of step 3 by assuming that broadleaf trees correspond to evergreen trees and conifers correspond to deciduous trees. Last but not least, MaTREEd currently allows users to run simulations by adding any number of trees in any neighborhood, which is clearly not possible given that the available space for planting new trees is finite. This limitation could be overcome by using the dataset of [tree grates in Madrid](https://challenge.greemta.eu/data/green/trees_madrid.zip), which includes the places planned to host a tree along a street and is also available at the [challenge webpage on trees](https://challenge.greemta.eu/dataset/trees/) (although it was provided later during the challenge).

Despite the underlying model can be improved, MaTREEd still holds the potential to be spread and scaled. The open source license (EUPL) under which the software is distributed allows organisations to replicate it anywhere else at the urban level. Scaling-up MaTREEd would instead require building a suitable infrastructure to support larger-scale implementations, e.g. on a region or a country. This would require, at least, building ad hoc APIs to allow computation and simulation using trees belonging to any species (a valuable example is the [GlobAllomeTree](http://www.globallometree.org/) platform, which makes use of species-specific allometric equations) and relying on suitable cloud-based infrastructures to enable fast, efficient and secure data processing.
