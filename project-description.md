## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>

MaTREEd is developed using the following datasets:

* **[trees in Madrid](https://challenge.greemta.eu/data/green/trees_madrid.zip)**, downloaded from the [challenge webpage on trees](https://challenge.greemta.eu/dataset/trees/) and including all the trees managed by the Municipality of Madrid, excluding trees in parks and gardens, areas of property or areas of recent construction not yet received by the Municipality. The dataset, which overall consists of 655‚Äô650 trees (point features), is provided by Madrid City Council under [this license](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default), which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/). The dataset is used as input to calculate and simulate the tree carbon stock for each neighborhood (see the [Methodology](#methodology) section);

* **[neighborhoods in Madrid](https://challenge.greemta.eu/data/administrative_units/neighborhoods_madrid.geojson)**, downloaded from the [challenge webpage on administrative units](https://challenge.greemta.eu/dataset/administrativeunits/) and including the 131 neighborhoods (polygon features) in which Madrid is divided. The dataset is provided by Madrid City Council under [this license](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.3efdb29b813ad8241e830cc2a8a409a0/?vgnextoid=108804d4aab90410VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=b4c412b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default), which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the [open data portal of Madrid](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=46b55cde99be2410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default). The dataset is used as the areal unit for the calculation and simulation of the tree carbon stock for each neighborhood (see the [Methodology](#methodology) section);

* **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)**, the geospatial database of the whole world created and managed by volunteers and [available under the ODbL license](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). The OpenStreetMap database is not used directly (i.e. as single geospatial features), but through [map tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles) (in particular the [standard tile layer](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Standard_tile_layer)) used as the basemap in the MaTREEd web application. 


## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

To be used in MaTREEd web application, the datasets of trees and neighborhoods in Madrid are processed to achieve the following: 1) cleaning; 2) intersection with the dataset of neighborhoods in Madrid and calculation of tree summary statistics for each neighborhood; and 3) calculation of the tree carbon stock and sequestration rate for each neighborhood. Each of these three steps is described in the following. The code used to perform such processing steps is written in Python and makes use of some standard libraries ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/)). The whole processing script is available as an interactive [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and can be launched from [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GISdevio/MaTREEd/main) (NOTE: loading the environment may take a while).

1. Through a sequence of pre-processing steps, the dataset of trees in Madrid is cleaned by:

  * removing all the features (trees) having NaN values for the attributes `senescence`, `crown_diameter`, `height` and `trunk_girth`, which are the attributes used for computing the neighborhood statistics and the tree carbon indicators (see below); 
  * removing coarse outliers by filtering out extreme values for the attributes `crown_diameter`, `height` and `trunk_girth` using percentiles;

2. The datasets of trees and neighborhoods in Madrid are spatially joined in order to add the neighborhood information to each tree. This allows to compute the following tree summary statistics ‚Äì corresponding to the maps shown in the web application (see the [Webapp](#webapp) section) ‚Äì for each neighborhood, as follows:

  * **Tree density** [trees/km2] (`tree_density`): number of trees per km2
  * **Mean tree trunk girth** [m] (`mean_trunk_girth`): mean value of the `trunk girth` of the available trees
  * **Mean tree height** [m] (`mean_height`): mean value of the `height` of the available trees
  * **Mean tree canopy diameter** [m] (`mean_crown_diameter`): mean value of the `crown_diameter` of the available trees
  * **Tree canopy coverage** [%] (`tree_coverage`): percentage of the neighborhood area covered by trees, computed as `mean_crown_diameter*ùúã/neighborhood_area`, where `neighborhood area` is the area of the neighborhood
  * **Fractions of deciduous and evergreen trees** [%] (`fraction_deciduous`) and (`fraction_evergreen`): percentage of deciduous and evergreen trees of the total number of available trees (`trees_count`).
  * **Tree species** (`tree_species`): the percentages of occurrence of the three most popular tree species, and the percentage of occurrence of all the other tree species (considered together)

3. The tree carbon stock and annual sequestration rate for each neighborhood are computed as the sum of the CO<sub>2</sub> stocked and the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration rate contributed by each single tree available in the neighborhood. In turn, these are computed using simplified [allometric equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_allometry) based on the `trunk_girth`, the tree diameter (`diameter`, computed as `trunk_girth/ùúã`) and the value of the `senescence` attribute - distinguishing between deciduous trees (value `CADUCIFOLIO`) and evergreen trees (value `PERENNIFOLIO`) - as follows:

* **CO<sub>2</sub> stock** [Kg] (`stock`):

```
if senescence == PERENNIFOLIO
    stock = (0.16155*((trunk_girth/ùúã)*100)^2.310647)*0.5*3.67
if senescence == CADUCIFOLIO
    stock = (0.035702*((trunk_girth/ùúã)*100)^2.580671)*0.5*3.67
```

where `0.5` is the fraction of the average carbon content on the tree‚Äôs dry weight total volume and `3.67` is the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> to C (`44/12 = 3.67`) (see [here](https://www.ecomatcher.com/how-to-calculate-co2-sequestration/)); the multiplier `100` is used because the calculation assumes that the value of `trunk_girth/ùúã`, i.e. `diameter`, is expressed in cm. These equations are presented and explained in [this scientific paper](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/mcpherson/psw_2011_mcpherson009.pdf). 

* **CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration** [Kg/y] (`sequestration`): 

```
diameter_t0 = (trunk_girth_t0/ùúã)*100
diameter_t1 = diameter_t0 + (-0.5425 + 0.3189*ln((trunk_girth_t0/ùúã)*100))
sequestration = stock(t1) - stock(t0)
```

where `diameter_t0` and `diameter_t1` are the initial diameter of the tree and the diameter of the tree after one year, respectively; `trunk_girth_t0` is the initial trunk girth of the tree; and `stock(t1)` and `stock(t0)` are the initial tree carbon stock and the tree carbon stock after one year, which are computed through the equation above using the initial value and the value after one year of `trunk_girth`. The equation models the annual growth of the diameter of a tree and is derived from [this scientific paper](https://iforest.sisef.org/contents/?id=ifor0635-005).

For each neighborhood, the absolute values of `stock` and `sequestration` are finally divided by the area to obtain the **areal CO<sub>2</sub> stock** [Kg/km2] (`areal_stock`) and the **areal CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration** [Kg/y/km2] (`areal_sequestration`).


## Webapp <a name="webapp"></a>

As mentioned in the [Introduction] section, the MaTREEd web application acts as a tree information system for Madrid neighborhoods offering two main functions: i) visualization of the results achieved by applying the methodology described above, which depicts the current situation in Madrid in terms of carbon stock and sequestration rate; and ii) simulation of the increase in the carbon stock and sequestration rate, in any user-defined scenario where a certain number of trees with specific characteristics are added in a neighborhood.

The interface of the web application consists of a main map viewer and a layer menu on the right side. The map viewer displays the layer selected in the layer menu (only one layer at a time) on top of the OpenStreetMap basemap. When selected, the layers available in the layer menu show various thematic maps according to the values of the tree summary statistics computed in step 2 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section for each neighborhood, i.e. `tree_density`, `mean_trunk_girth`, `mean_height`, `mean_height`, `mean_crown_diameter` and `tree_coverage`. From the layer menu, the maps of areal carbon stock and areal sequestration rate for each neighborhood, i.e. `areal_stock` and `areal_sequestration`, respectively, are also available. Each of the seven thematic maps is accompanied by its own legend displaying the quantitative intervals of the classes depicted in the map. The selected layer is automatically moved at the top of the layer tree.

When a neighborhood is clicked on the map, a table appears on the left side of the interface showing additional information on that neighborhood. This includes the total number of available trees (`trees_count`), the number of valid tree records (i.e. the number of records remaining after cleaning, see step 1 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section), the fractions of deciduous and evergreen trees (`fraction_deciduous` and `fraction_evergreen`, respectively), the percentages of occurrence of the three most popular tree species and of the other species (`tree_species`), and the absolute values of carbon stock and sequestration rate (`stock` and `sequestration`, respectively). 

QUI METTERE SCREENSHOT DEL VIEWER

At the bottom of the table, a _Close_ button closes the table while a _Run simulation_ button opens a new dialogue allowing MaTREEd users to simulate how much the carbon stock and sequestration rate in the selected neighborhood increase when new trees are planted. In detail, users can arbitrarily define the number of conifer and/or broadleaf trees to plant and their `diameter`. Using the equations available in step 3 of the [Methodology](#methodology) section, the additional carbon stock (`delta_stock`) and sequestration rate (`delta_sequestration`) contributed by the new trees are computed, and the total (simulated) carbon stock (`final_stock`) and sequestration rate (`final_sequestration`) for the neighborhood are computed as the sum of the current ones (`current_stock` and `current_sequestration`) and additional ones:

```
final_stock = current_stock + delta_stock
final_sequestration = current_sequestration + delta_sequestration
```

Finally, the percentage of increase of carbon stock (`increase_stock`) and sequestration rate (`increase_sequestration`) are computed as:

```
increase_stock = delta_stock/current_stock*100
increase_sequestration = delta_sequestration/current_sequestration*100
```
