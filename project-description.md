## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>

MaTREEd is developed using the following datasets:

* **trees in Madrid**, downloaded from the challenge webpage on trees and including all the trees managed by the Municipality of Madrid, excluding trees in parks and gardens, areas of property or areas of recent construction not yet received by the Municipality. The dataset, which overall consists of 655â€™650 trees (point features), is provided by Madrid City Council under this license, which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the open data portal of Madrid. The dataset is used as input to calculate and simulate the tree carbon stock for each neighbourhood (see the Methodology section);

* **neighbourhoods in Madrid**, downloaded from the challenge webpage on administrative units and including the 131 neighbourhoods (polygon features) in which Madrid is divided. The dataset is provided by Madrid City Council under this license, which allows the reuse for commercial and non-commercial purposes, and is available on the open data portal of Madrid. The dataset is used as the areal unit for the calculation and simulation of the tree carbon stock for each neighbourhood (see the Methodology section);

* **OpenStreetMap**, the geospatial database of the whole world created and managed by volunteers and available under the ODbL license. The OpenStreetMap database is not used directly (i.e. as single geospatial features), but through map tiles (in particular the standard tile layer) used as the basemap in the MaTREEd web application.
