# MaTREEd web application

This directory includes the code of the MaTREEd web application, accessible from [here](https://gisdevio.github.io/MaTREEd/#/).

The web application displays a map of Madrid neighborhoods and shows the related attributes, including the carbon stock and sequestration rate, derived from the data processing. In addition, it offers a simulator of the increase of carbon stock and sequestration rate, in any user-defined scenario where a certain number of trees with specific characteristics are added in a neighborhood. A comprehensive description of the web application is included in [this section](https://github.com/GISdevio/MaTREEd/blob/main/project-description.md#webapp) of the project description.

The web application is developed using the JavaScript libraries [React](https://it.reactjs.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
